            SSTV images from the International Space Station using a hand-held transceiver (Baofeng UV-5R) in January
            2020.

           <span class="start">Amateur Radio</span>  on the International Space Station (ARISS) is a program to connect students and amateur radio
            enthusiasts from around the world to the astronauts at ISS. In this program, astronauts transmit some
            signals for amateur radio enthusiasts to receive them. These signals are usually encoded images transmitted
            using the SSTV communication protocol. Inter-MAI-75 (Formation and Popularization of Space Exploration) is
            an experiment by the Moscow Aviation Institute under the ARISS program. Here are some of the images
            successfully received and decoded by our team members

            Due to the coronavirus pandemic and lack of access to our ground station and equipment, we decided to widen
            our scope and explore virtual tracking with the help of webSDRs. It is done by accessing ground stations
            across the world to receive signals. The members of the Student Satellite Program are regularly trained and
            made to compete online to track satellites and receive signals. <br><span class="start">NOAA </span>is a US-based agency that deploys a
            series of weather satellites in space and sends images of the Earth. We successfully tracked NOAA 15,18 and
            19 to receive images of the Earth above Europe and America.
